YAHB (Yet Another Hardlink-based Backup-Tool)
Version 1.0.0.0
Copyright (c) 2019 Dominik Klein

     Syntax:: yahb.exe <source-dir> <target-dir> [<options>]

 source-dir:: source directory (i.e. C:\MyFiles)
 target-dir:: target directory (i.e. D:\Backups)

TYPICAL EXAMPLE:

 yahb c:\MyFiles d:\Backup /s /xf:*.tmp

will copy all files and the directory structure from c:\MyFiles
to d:\Backup\YYYYMMDDHHMM, including all subdirectories. Yahb will
also look for previous backups of c:\MyFiles in d:\Backup, and if
a file has not changed, it will create a hardlink to that location.
Moreover, all files with ending .tmp will be skipped.

OPTIONS

  /copyall                 :: copy ALL files. Otherwise the following directory
                              patterns and file types are excluded:

                              DIRECTORIES:
                              - 'System Volume Information'
                              - 'AppData\Local\Temp'
                              - 'AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache'
                              - 'C:\Windows'
                              - '$Recycle.Bin'

                              FILES AND PLACEHOLDERS:
                              - hiberfil.sys
                              - pagefile.sys
                              - swapfile.sys
                              - *.~
                              - *.temp

  /files:PAT1;PAT2;...     :: copy only files that match the supplied
                              file patterns (like *.exe)

  /help                    :: display this help screen

  /id:FILENAME             :: supply a list of Input Directories to copy which
                              are stored line by line in a textfile FILENAME.
                              If this options is used, <source-dir> can be
                              omitted. If both <source-dir> and /id:FILENAME
                              are present, all directories will be copied.
                              NOTE that if /s is provided, it will be 
                              applied to the list of input directories, and
                              will also be applied to <source-dir>.

  /list                    :: do not copy anything, just list all files

  /log:FILENAME            :: write all output (log) to a textfile FILNAME.
                              If FILENAME exists, it will be overwritten

  /+log:FILENAME           :: same as /log:FILENAME, but always append, i.e.
                              do not not overwrite FILENAME if it exists.

  /pause                   :: after finishing, wait for the user to press
                              ENTER before closing the program. This
                              prevents a command - prompt from vanishing
                              after finishing if run e.g.by Windows' RUNAS
                              command

  /s                       :: also copy all SUBDIRECTORIES of <source-dir>

  /tee                     :: even if /log:FILENAME or /+log:FILENAME is
                              chosen, still write everything additionally
                              to console output.

  /verbose                 :: by default, only the progress and errors 
                              are output to the console/log. In verbose
                              mode, all created files and directories
                              are listed - note that for large copy
                              operations, this frequent output to console
                              will slow down the overal operation

  /vss                     :: If a file is currently in use, and cannot be
                              accessed, try to still copy that file by using
                              Windows' Volume Shadow Copy Service.
